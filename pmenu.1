pmenu \- pie menu utility for X
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pmenu
.RB [ \-p ]
.RB [ \-r
.IR button ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmenu
is a pie menu for X,
it reads a list of newline-separated items from stdin,
shows a pie menu for the user to select one of the items,
and outputs the item selected to stdout.
The pie menu contains one slice for each item.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP
.BI "\-m " modifier
Use the button click specified by the
.B \-r
option with the given modifier number
to spawn the pie menu.
For example,
if calling pmenu with
.B -r 3 -m 4
options,
the pie menu will be displayed when clicking any window with the right mouse button
and the Mod4 modifier (usually the Super key).
This option only makes sense when
.B \-r
is used.
.TP
.B \-p
When
.B \-r
is used, pass the click to the root window,
for the window manager to use it, for example.
This may open the window manager's menu (if it has one).
This option only makes sense when
.B \-r
is used.
.TP
.BI "\-r " button
When this option is used,
.B pmenu
listens to button presses on the root window,
and shows the pie menu when the button (a number between 1 and 5) is pressed on the root window.
This option makes
.B pmenu
run continuously,
so it should be run in background on a X startup file (like ~/.xinitrc, ~/.xprofile, etc).
.PP
Each item read from stdin has the following format:
.IP
.EX
ITEM := [TABS] (IMAGE|LABEL) [TABS OUTPUT] NEWLINE
.EE
.PP
That means that each item is composed by
tabs, followed by an optional image specificationor a label, followed by
more tabs, followed by an output, and ended by a newline.  Brackets
group optional elements; vertical line (|) separates elements that
cannot be used together.
.IP
The initial tabs indicate the menu hierarchy:
items indented with a tab is shown in a submenu of the preceding item not indented.
An item without initial tabs is a top-level item.
.IP
The image is a string of the form "IMG:/path/to/image.png".
It specifies a image to be shown as icon in the slice.
.IP
The label is the string that will be shown as a item in the menu.
.IP
The output is the string that will be output after selecting the item.
If an item does not have an output, its label is used as its output.
.IP
The newline terminates the item specification.
